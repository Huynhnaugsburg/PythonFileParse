Medieval Life in 12th-Century Europe
4 Semester Credits
This is the introductory course for medieval studies. It uses an interdisciplinary approach to study European culture
during a period known as the High Middle Ages, roughly AD 1100 to 1300. It attempts to examine medieval culture as a
complex system of thought and feeling, which includes history, religion, philosophy, literature, art, theatre, music, and
food. It also takes an experiential approach to this material, for example, by having students and faculty attend class in
academic regalia, just as they did in medieval universities.

Keystone: Medieval Studies Project
4 Semester Credits
The final project in medieval studies functions like an independent study. Because medieval studies is an
interdisciplinary major, the final project must be also be interdisciplinary. Students are free to choose any topic
connected to the Middle Ages, but must examine it with professors from at least three different disciplines. The
traditional disciplines that comprise medieval studies are art history, English, history, music history, philosophy, religion,
and theater history, but students have also completed projects involving professors from other disciplines, such as
149

sociology and psychology. Experiential approaches are encouraged but not required. For example, past students have
built medieval musical instruments, medieval suits of armor, and Renaissance commedia dell’arte masks, and then
written about the process.

These organizations continually adapt to new circumstances, usually coordinating change in a variety of different
functional areas. Strategy, in its broadest sense, is a major determinant of long-term performance differentials. Strategy
matches the organization’s capabilities to its market position, facilitates resource allocation, and provides guidance for
decision-making. Student learning experience two is embedded in this course using a business simulation.

Music Theory and Aural Skills I
4 Semester Credits
Theory & Aural Skills I is the first semester course of a 4-semester theory and musicianship program that serves as the
foundation for all music majors. Over the course of the 4-semester sequences, the core music curriculum (theory, ear
training, piano courses) students will “do what musicians do.” The students will build musical comprehension by hearing,
reading, interpreting, composing, and improvising music; they will develop, and participate in, a community committed
to improving musical skills, and learning from one another. Learning these skills will enable lifelong learning, through
and beyond music.

musical language in the Western tradition, with a special focus on issues related to harmony. The main goal is to gain a
thorough grasp of music fundamentals and their application to all kinds of music-making (performance, composition,
analysis, improvisation).

E.D. Hirsch describes cultural literacy as “the network of information that all competent readers possess.” This course
draws students into that information web using the history of Western art music as the thread that ties culture together
from the Middle Ages to the present. A “top ten of the last millennium” will provide mileposts for understanding music
in social context. Live performance will be a feature of this course. Evaluation of student work will include short essay
papers, several quizzes, and a midterm and final examination. The ability to read music is not required.

spiritual functioning of individuals, families and groups served by supervisees. Students hone skills necessary for each of
the stages of the supervisory process (planning, beginning, work, and ending), and they build a repertoire of supervisory
questions that have been associated in research with fostering success in meeting clients’ goals. Students learn to
differentiate supervision with its dimensions of hierarchical power, responsibility, liability, and authority from peer
consultation. They gain competencies in both individual and group supervision, as well as competencies related to
consultation with a multicultural lens to advance the application of theories and models of clinical social work practice.
